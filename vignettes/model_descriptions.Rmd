The Microbial-Explicit-Model-Comparison package or `MEMC` is a tool designed to provide an easy-to-use, flexible framework to facilitate the easy exploration of different structures of microbial-explicit models. See below for a description of the different models and structures are currently supported by the package. 

# Models

## `MEND`

The `MEND` function is the coded version of the MEND 2013 model, originally documented in [Wang et. al 2013](https://doi.org/10.1890/12-0681.1). It is a system of differential equations that describe soil carbon dynamics. There are 8 different carbon pools: particulate carbon, mineral-associated carbon, active layers of MOC interacting with dissolved organic carbon through adsorption and desorption, dissolved carbon, microbial
biomass carbon, and two different types of extracellular enzymes denoted as the circles in the **Fig. 1**. For more information about the MEND 2013 model, we encourage users to read [Wang et. al 2013](https://doi.org/10.1890/12-0681.1).

## `MEND2`

The `MEND2` function is a modfied form of `MEND` that has two POC, MOC, DOC, and enzyme pools as indicated in **Fig. 2.**

# Structural Variations of Microbial Uptake

There are different ways to represent the carbon uptake by microbial biomass. One of the objectives of this package is to allow users to explore what happens when this flux (highlighted as the green arrow in **Fig 3**) is changed. Modeling microbial uptake with different equations leads to different model behavior by accounting or emphasizing different dynamics.

## Michaelis–Menten

The original MEND model uses Michaelis–Menten kinetics (eq. 1) to model microbial uptake of carbon.

## Reverse Michaelis–Menten 

An alterative configuration uses resverse Michaelis–Menten enzyme dynamics (RM). The switch to RM dynamics as in equation 2, assumes within our system that there is a surplus DOC available for microbial uptake. Meaning that now microbial uptake of carbon is limited by the ability of the microbial community to break down and consume DOC.

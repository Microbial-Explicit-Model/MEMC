title: "Fit model to data"

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how the `MEMC` package can be used to fit SOC models to observational or experimental data. Here we will inorganic carbon measurements from XXXX. This article assumes the package has already been [installed](Install-Build.Rmd) and that users are familiar with the [solving and setting up MEMC runs](Getting-Started.Rmd). 


## Set Up 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# This assumes that the MEMC package has already been installed. 
library(MEMC)

# Used to visualize results
library(ggplot2)  

# set a theme to use in all the plots
theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.title = element_blank()))
```
